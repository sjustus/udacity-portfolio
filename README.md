Front-End Nanodegree Portfolio Project

## About
This webisite is the portfolio of Shayna Ahamed. It was built as the final project for the Web Foundations segment of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program.

## Details
This website was built with HTML and CSS. The layout was done with CSS Flexbox.

The design of the site is based of the mockup provided by Udacity. The conditions of the project were to use the mockup for the basic design, but with added customizations. I used the same layout but replaced the three design colors with three of my own choosing. I also chose custom fonts which I linked from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Contents
There are no projects currently posted to the website. The website contains placeholder content and images. The hero image is a public domain stock photo, and I used the website [Place Kitten](http://placekitten.com/) for the images on the cards. The logo is also a placeholder, made using a [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) template.
